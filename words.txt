using the debugger, i was able to determine the cause of one of my errors.
The program would cause a segmentation fault when the recursive case did not terminate correctly.
By adding a breakpoint at the `highest` function, I was able to check the median each recursive call
Being able to single step through a program is very helpful, especially when working with pointers.

Also, I had many issues with ensuring that the program used pointers correctly.
